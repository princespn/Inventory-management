Homescapes now offer their products direct to the consumer at a price that provides excellent value for money by cutting out the middlemen and passing the savings directly on to the consumer. This means that the benefit of Homescapes' over two decades of textiles experience can be yours at a fantastic price. Homescapes fully control all aspects of design, production and distribution ensuring quality throughout. This bedding has been manufactured with long staple cotton fibre in one of the most advanced spinning mills in the world. The fabric is then carefully woven and inspected to make it suitable for the exacting standards of the luxury hotels worldwide. This is a true high thread count fabric as only single count yarns are used, not twisted yarns which are offered by some manufacturers which effectively halve the quality of the product. Such a high density weave means that most allergens and mites are eliminated. This bedding range has been assembled in an environment, where quality is paramount. You can easily tell by looking at the quality of packaging and the feel of the fabric. Homescapes ensure that the stitch length is uniformly high. Duvet covers and pillow cases have deep overlaps, making it very easy for you to change the covers and the covers will not come off whilst being used. Since the overlapping fabric is deep, you cannot see the duvet/pillow after covering them. This is exactly the same as you would see in 5 to 7 star hotel bedding.
